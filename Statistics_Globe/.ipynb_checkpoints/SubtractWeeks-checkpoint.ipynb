    "First, we have to load datetime and timedelta from the datetime module:\n",
    "\n",
    "from datetime import datetime, timedelta                    # Import modules in Python\n",
    "We use the following example data as a basement for this Python programming tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_date = datetime.today()                                  # Create Example date\n",

    "Example 1: Add Specific Number of Weeks to Date\n",
    "In this example, I’ll explain how to add a certain number of weeks to our example date.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we can apply the timedelta function in combination with the weeks argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_date_weeks_added = my_date + timedelta(weeks = 14)       # Adding weeks using the timedelta function\n",
    "print(my_date_weeks_added)                                  # Show date object with added weeks\n",
    "# 2022-09-16 16:38:23.520823\n",
    "As demonstrated by the output above, 14 weeks have been added to our example datetime object.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Subtract Specific Number of Weeks from Date\n",
    "Of course, it’s also possible to remove weeks from a datetime object, this is what I’ll show you in the next example.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_date_weeks_subtracted = my_date - timedelta(weeks = 14)  # Subtracting days with the timedelta function\n",
    "print(my_date_weeks_subtracted)                             # Print date object with subtracted weeks\n",
    "# 2022-03-04 16:38:23.520823\n",
    "Considering the Python code above, we simply have changed the operator before our timedelta function from ‘+’ to ‘-‘ and the certain number of weeks will be subtracted.\n",

    "Video & Further Resources\n",
