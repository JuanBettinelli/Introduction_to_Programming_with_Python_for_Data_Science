# Preparations

## New environment

- Create a new conda environment, to separate the Lecture content from your installation
  - using the anaconda navigator might be the easiest
  - quickest option to get jupyter-lab and the plugins we used last week: clone the basics_310 environment in the Anaconda Navigator
- Install a new Jupyter kernel that you can use, if you would like to start in Jupyter
  - This still needs to be run in the terminal (prompt, console,...). See `python_basics.ipynb`.
  - Make sure you activated the project environment first
- Find a catchy name for your project.
  - Helpful: e.g. [Acronym Generators](https://acronym-generator.com/index.php)
    - First come first serve
- Let me know the name, I will create a new Project for your team in `codeberg`.
  - clone the new repository (not into the `python_course`-git-folder!)
  - copy the `.gitignore` from the `python_course` git repository to the new project
  - add, commit, and push the the new `.gitignore`
  - add your names to the README.md
- create a new folder in the new project git repository called `data`.
  - it will not show up in `git status` calls when you copied the `.gitignore` file.
  - **Beware** please do not commit larger files to your git repository!
- download the historic test data, unpack (2.55 GB) to the new `data` folder
- You can copy the `ipynb` file from the `python_course/project` folder the your new project
- Check if it works (runs through)

## How to approach implementation?

## What should be the goal?
- Get minimum implementation done as a team
- Explore possible extra tasks
- Take your time to explore the packages
  - pandas
  - plotting libraries
- Work in pairs, or in groups of three
  - you can try to solve subproblems in these groups, then compare the implementations
  - you can also split project subproblems in the groups and then learn from each other.
