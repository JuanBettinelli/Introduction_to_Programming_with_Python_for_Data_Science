# Help with visualizations needed

Dear Experts,

we got a very interesting dataset containing the internet usage, prizes, and speeds for a lot of countries.

Can you help us to find interesting information from this data?
If would be great if you could provide some graphics that we can publish in our next issue in August?

Thank you very much!
